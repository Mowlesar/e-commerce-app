## Description
This application simplifies inventory management, allowing users to categorize items and efficiently search their inventory using unique IDs. It comprises three primary tables: "tags," "products," and "categories" for structured item tracking.

To begin, users should install necessary packages with "npm i" and create the database using 'schema.sql' found in the 'db' folder. They can then choose to either populate it with 'npm run seed' or input their data using 'node server.js.' Database manipulation is done through Insomnia.
